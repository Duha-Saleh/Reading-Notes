The <table> element is used to add tables to a web
page.
X A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <tr> element.
X Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
X You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
X For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.
n addition to the CSS properties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
X List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
X Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
X Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
X Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.
