*first of all it speaks about the structure of the html code which are the head and the body 
and what are the opining and closing tags*

*HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning*

*Tags are often referred to as elements*

*tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end*

*Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element*

*Attributes require a name and a value*

# Chapter8
DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.


 You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.


The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

 <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

 The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.


 Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages

# Chapter17+18

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
