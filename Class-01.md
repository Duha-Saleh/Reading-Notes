 <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed. The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

block-level elements.


 To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
