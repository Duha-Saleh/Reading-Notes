DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.


 You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.


The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

# Chapter17+18

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
