The name of a constructor function usually begins
with a capital letter (unlike other functions, which
tend to begin with a lowercase character).
Each statement that creates a new property or
method for this object ends in a semicolon (not a
comma, which is used in the literal syntax).
108 FUNCTIONS, METHODS & OBJECTS
The uppercase letter is supposed to help remind
developers to use the new keyword when they create
an object using that function .

Programmers use a lot of name/value pairs:
• HTML uses attribute names and values.
• CSS uses property names and values.
In JavaScript:
• Variables have a name and you can assign them a
value of a string, number, or Boolean.
• Arrays have a name and a group of values. (Each
item in an array is a name/value pair because it
has an index number and a value.)
• Named functions have a name and value that is a
set of statements to run if the function is called.
• Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs
