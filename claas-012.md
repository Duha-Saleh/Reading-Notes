- Drawing a line chart
To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page:

<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>


- to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element:

<script>
    var buyers = document.getElementById('buyers').getContext('2d');
    new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);
</script>

-we could provide a text description of the canvas content or provide a static image of the dynamically rendered content. This can look something like this:

<canvas id="stockGraph" width="150" height="150">
  current stock price: $3.15 + 0.15
</canvas>

<canvas id="clock" width="150" height="150">
  <img src="images/clock.png" width="150" height="150" alt=""/>
</canvas>
